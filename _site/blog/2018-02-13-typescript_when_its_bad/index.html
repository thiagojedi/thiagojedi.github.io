That's why, when someone try to sell me a new tech I go ahead and ask: Ok, where's the catch? This
is my answer to that question about TypeScript.</p>
<h2>JavaScript with types? Wtf?!</h2>
<p>Right. You've been away from the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f" title="How it feels to learn javascript in 2016">"JavaScript land"</a> in the last couple years. You may have
missed the recent growth of <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" title="TypeScript's official page">TypeScript</a>. The idea behind this language from Microsoft is that
static typing would help IDEs and code editors perform better with JavaScript, enabling it to be a
better language for really large projects.</p>
<p>"JavaScript that scales", as they say.</p>
<p>What sets TypeScript apart from most static typed languages is that its type system is structural
and optional. The former means you don't need all the members of the object your function receives,
only the ones it cares. Is like a static duck typing. The later means you can relax, write pure
JavaScript and add type notation only where you feel it's needed. It's architect, Anders Hejlsberg,
calls this concept <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5uaIwM-7pU" title=".NET Rocks! #1460 - TypeScript and Beyond with Anders Hejlsberg">"gradual typing"</a>.</p>
<p><em>Wait! If this static duck typing is so great, why it's optional?</em></p>
<p>Well, because it solves one type of problems but brings others with it (pun intended). Let me tell
you when not to use them and stay with pure JS.</p>
<h2>Tests</h2>
<p>You should have guessed when I told you not all problems are solved by static types. If that was
true, there would be no sense in have unit tests in languages like Java or C#. Sure, parameters in
TS compiler like <code>strictNullChecks</code> saves you from a lot of headaches (have you tried <code>x &gt;= 0</code> when
<code>x</code> is <code>null</code>?), but there's still the need for tests, including for type errors.</p>
<p>The thing is that TypeScript compiles (transpiles?) to JavaScript. This means most of the time your
code will run in an ecosystem that doesn't have the same safeguards you have while developing. The
best way to guarantee your code won't have problems is testing it in the target language.</p>
<h2>Existing Code</h2>
<p>Do not rewrite code unless you really need to.</p>
<p>If you already have an existing project, it's well tested, you should focus in developing new
features and fixing bugs, not reinventing the wheel. Most of the time starting from scratch is just
waste of resources.</p>
<p>TypeScript can live side by side with JavaScript code, be it at file level or project level. There's
a compiler option called <code>allowJs</code> that is self explanatory. So, if you think your project really
needs the advantages of static type checking, you may start using it in new modules.</p>
<p>Every project has that one module written by that former colleague who's nowhere to be found and
nobody knows how but it Just Works™. Don't touch it.</p>
<h2>Small projects</h2>
<p>Let's say you had the idea to create a small NodeJS program that lists your video folder and renames
all the files from a name pattern like "TvShow - 2x14" to "TvShow S02E14". I think you can do that
in a single <code>rename_episodes.js</code> file with less than 100 line of code.</p>
<p>It's pretty small, don't you think? No external dependencies, you can make it to work only with you
current folder structure and you probably won't use it anywhere else. Unless you're writing that
script to learn TypeScript, the process of annotate the types and compiling will annoy you more than
help you.</p>
<p>The same goes for client-side code: Working with simple DOM handling, form validation, or code that
doesn't need the new features from "ESnext". You don't need a new language, use what the browsers
run.</p>
<p>Remember that HTML attributes may not be the types you expect and the static typing might <a href="https://blog.jayway.com/2016/05/06/typescript-web-and-the-illusive-type-safety-advantage/" title="TypeScript, web and the illusive type-safety-advantage">confuse
your debugging</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The bottom line is: where JavaScript is strong, keep it there. Do not change your team's development
process just because it's the new trend and all the cool kids are using this or that. Especially if
that team consists of only you.</p>
<p>You don't need to change your code to get most of the advantages enabled by TypeScript thanks to
community projects like <a href="http://definitelytyped.org/" title="DefinitelyTyped project page">DefinitelyTyped</a>, that publishes definition files (equivalent to
header files from C++) for existing JS libraries.</p>
<p>TS was created for a particular case and it's ok if you're not its target user. And if you are, know
that you can change at you own pace. There's a great <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Conversion-Guide#typescript-react-conversion-guide" title="TypeScript React Conversion Guide">migration guide</a> that may help get
there.</p>
<p>Be wise. And may the Force be with you.</p>

<p>So. Beginning with this post, I'll write all my technical posts in english. As for the posts about
career will write in portuguese. I'm doing it to better reach the intended target readers.</p>
<p>I'm also deactivating the comment session, as nobody used it and was kinda buggy. Any questions, you
may find me on twitter.</p>
